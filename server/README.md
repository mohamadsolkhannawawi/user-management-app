## File Explanations

*   **`.env`**:
    This file stores environment variables, such as database connection strings and API keys, keeping sensitive information separate from the codebase.

*   **`.gitignore`**:
    Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore, such as `node_modules/` and `.env`.

*   **`package-lock.json`**:
    Records the exact versions of all dependencies and their sub-dependencies, ensuring consistent installations across different environments.

*   **`package.json`**:
    Defines the project's metadata, scripts, and lists all direct dependencies required for the server to run.

*   **`tsconfig.json`**:
    TypeScript configuration file, specifying compiler options and root files for the project.

*   **`node_modules/`**:
    Contains all installed Node.js modules (dependencies) for the project.

*   **`prisma/`**:
    This directory holds all Prisma-related files for database management.
    *   **`migrations/`**:
        Contains SQL migration files generated by Prisma to evolve the database schema.
        *   **`20250921040129_create_user_table/`**:
            A specific migration folder, containing the `migration.sql` file for creating the user table.
        *   **`migration.sql`**:
            The actual SQL script executed to apply the database schema changes for the `create_user_table` migration.
    *   **`migration_lock.toml`**:
        Prisma's internal file to manage migration history and ensure consistency.
    *   **`schema.prisma`**:
        The Prisma schema file, defining the database models, relations, and data sources. This is the single source of truth for your database schema.
    *   **`seed.ts`**:
        A script used to populate the database with initial data, useful for development and testing.

*   **`src/`**:
    This directory contains the main source code for the server application.
    *   **`controllers/`**:
        Handles incoming requests, processes them, and sends back responses. It interacts with the `services` layer.
        *   **`user.controller.ts`**:
            Contains the logic for handling user-related API requests (e.g., creating, reading, updating, deleting users).
    *   **`routes/`**:
        Defines the API endpoints and maps them to the appropriate controller functions.
        *   **`user.routes.ts`**:
            Sets up the routes for user-related operations, linking URLs to `user.controller` methods.
    *   **`services/`**:
        Encapsulates the business logic and interacts directly with the data layer (Prisma).
        *   **`user.service.ts`**:
            Provides functions for performing business operations related to users, such as fetching users from the database or creating new ones.
    *   **`index.ts`**:
        The entry point of the server application. It initializes the Express app, sets up middleware, connects to the database, and starts the server.
